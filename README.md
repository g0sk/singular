# Stack

Stack is an android app made using [React native](https://reactnative.dev) which lets you scan RFID tags and update database assets.

### Start using it

In first place, follow the instructions on the [React native docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) to setup your environment correctly.

After setting up your environment, use `git clone https://github.com/g0sk/stack` on your preffered directory
Once you have cloned the repository, install the project dependencies with `yarn install` and finally you can simply start using it with `yarn android` or `yarn react-native run android`
